They have a bunch of algorithms (from the pre-ML-hype days) that take a variety of inputs to determine whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.

Fraud detection is a necessary evil for all financial transaction companies in order to keep costs low for everyone else.<p>If you’re worried about privacy, use CCPA’s right to information and ask them for a dump of everything they have on you.
