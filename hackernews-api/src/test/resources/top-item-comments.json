And they&#x27;re using it for different fraudulent activities - from making real  sales (just for stars) to bidding to own items (for rising price).<p>For years eBay fight this."

		"text": "eBay has a big fraud headache. They have a bunch of algorithms (from the pre-ML-hype days) that take a variety of inputs to determine whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not. Presence of remote login service on the user’s computer may tip the scale heavily in this calculation. Fraud detection is a necessary evil for all financial transaction companies in order to keep costs low for everyone else.<p>If you’re worried about privacy, use CCPA’s right to information and ask them for a dump of everything they have on you. They are supposed to give you info that other SPs like Threatmetrix have on you as well if they really are transmitting it to 3rd parties."
